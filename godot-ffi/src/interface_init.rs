//! # Modern 4.2+ API
//!
//! The extension entry point is passed `get_proc_address` function pointer, which can be used to load all other
//! GDExtension FFI functions dynamically. This is a departure from the previous struct-based approach.
//!
//! No longer supports Godot 4.0.x or 4.1.x.
//!
//! Relevant upstream PR: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76406>.
