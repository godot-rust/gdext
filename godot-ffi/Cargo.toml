# TODO: get rid of paste and gensym, they are trivially implementable with proc-macros. Update cargo-deny.
# Especially gensym which pulls in entire syn for 10 LoC. See https://github.com/regiontog/gensym/blob/master/src/lib.rs.
# Might however require godot-ffi to depend on godot-macro, which is not ideal...
