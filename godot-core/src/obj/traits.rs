///
/// The primary use case for this trait is polymorphism: you write a function that accepts anything that derives from a certain class
/// (including the class itself):
/// ```no_run
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// fn print_node<T>(node: Gd<T>)
/// where
///     T: Inherits<Node>,
/// {
///     let up = node.upcast(); // type Gd<Node> inferred
///     println!("Node #{} with name {}", up.instance_id(), up.get_name());
///     up.free();
/// }
///
/// // Call with different types
/// print_node(Node::new_alloc());   // works on T=Node as well
/// print_node(Node2D::new_alloc()); // or derived classes
/// print_node(Node3D::new_alloc());
/// ```
///
/// A variation of the above pattern works without `Inherits` or generics, if you move the `upcast()` into the call site:
/// ```no_run
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// fn print_node(node: Gd<Node>) { /* ... */ }
///
/// // Call with different types
/// print_node(Node::new_alloc());            // no upcast needed
/// print_node(Node2D::new_alloc().upcast());
/// print_node(Node3D::new_alloc().upcast());
