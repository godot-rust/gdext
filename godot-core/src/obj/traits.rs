///

/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// fn print_node<T>(node: Gd<T>)
/// where

///     up.free();
/// }
///
/// // Call with different types
/// print_node(Node::new_alloc());   // works on T=Node as well
/// print_node(Node2D::new_alloc()); // or derived classes
/// print_node(Node3D::new_alloc());
/// ```
///
/// A variation of the above pattern works without `Inherits` or generics, if you move the `upcast()` into the call site:
/// ```no_run
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// fn print_node(node: Gd<Node>) { /* ... */ }
///
/// // Call with different types
/// print_node(Node::new_alloc());            // no upcast needed
