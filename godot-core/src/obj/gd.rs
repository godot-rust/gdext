/// or user-declared structs (`#[derive(GodotClass)]`). It does **not** hold built-in types (`Vector3`, `Color`, `i32`).
///
/// `Gd<T>` never holds null objects. If you need nullability, use `Option<Gd<T>>`.
///
/// This smart pointer behaves differently depending on `T`'s associated types, see [`GodotClass`] for their documentation.
/// In particular, the memory management strategy is fully dependent on `T`:
///
/// * Objects of type [`RefCounted`] or inherited from it are **reference-counted**. This means that every time a smart pointer is
///   shared using [`Share::share()`], the reference counter is incremented, and every time one is dropped, it is decremented.
///   This ensures that the last reference (either in Rust or Godot) will deallocate the object and call `T`'s destructor.
///
/// * Objects inheriting from [`Object`] which are not `RefCounted` (or inherited) are **manually-managed**.
///   Their destructor is not automatically called (unless they are part of the scene tree). Creating a `Gd<T>` means that
///   you are responsible of explicitly deallocating such objects using [`Gd::free()`].
///
/// * For `T=Object`, the memory strategy is determined **dynamically**. Due to polymorphism, a `Gd<T>` can point to either
///   reference-counted or manually-managed types at runtime. The behavior corresponds to one of the two previous points.
///   Note that if the dynamic type is also `Object`, the memory is manually-managed.
