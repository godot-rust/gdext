/// Exported property that must be initialized in the editor (or associated code) before use.
///
/// Use this type whenever your Rust code cannot provide a value for a field, but expects one to be specified in the Godot editor.
///
/// If you need automatic initialization during `ready()`, e.g. for loading nodes or resources, use [`OnReady<Gd<T>>`](crate::obj::OnReady)
/// instead. As a general "maybe initialized" type, `Option<Gd<T>>` is always available, even if more verbose.
///
///
/// # What consitutes "initialized"?
///
/// Whether a value is considered initialized or not depends on `T`.
///
/// - For objects, a value is initialized if it is not null. Exported object propreties in Godot are nullable, but `Gd<T>` and `DynGd<T, D>` do
///   not support nullability and can thus not directly be exported with `#[export]`. `OnEditor` can bridge this gap, by expecting users
///   to set a non-null value, and panicking if they don't.
/// - For built-in types, a value is initialized if it is different from a user-selected sentinel value (e.g. `-1`).
///
/// More on this below (see also table-of-contents sidebar).
///
/// # Initialization semantics
///
/// Panics during access (`Deref/DerefMut` impls) if uninitialized.
///
/// When used inside a node class, `OnEditor` checks if a value has been set before `ready()` is run, and panics otherwise.
/// This validation is performed for all `OnEditor` fields declared in a given `GodotClass`, regardless of whether they are `#[var]`, `#[export]`, or neither.
/// Once initialized, `OnEditor` can be used almost as if it were a `T` value itself, due to `Deref`/`DerefMut` impls.
///
/// `OnEditor<T>` should always be used as a struct field, preferably in tandem with an `#[export]` or `#[var]`.
/// Initializing `OnEditor` values via code before the first use is supported, but should be limited to use cases involving builder or factory patterns.
///
///
/// # Using `OnEditor` with classes
///
/// You can wrap class smart pointers `Gd<T>` and `DynGd<T, D>` inside `OnEditor`, to make them exportable.
/// `Gd<T>` itself does not implement the `Export` trait.
///
/// ## Example: automatic init
///
/// This example uses the `Default` impl, which expects a non-null value to be provided.
///
/// ```
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// #[derive(GodotClass)]
/// #[class(init, base = Node)]
/// struct ResourceHolder {
///     #[export]
///     editor_property: OnEditor<Gd<Resource>>,
/// }
///
/// #[godot_api]
/// impl INode for ResourceHolder {
///     fn ready(&mut self) {
///         // Will always be valid and **must** be set via editor.
///         // Additional check is being run before ready(),
///         // to ensure that given value can't be null.
///         let some_variant = self.editor_property.get_meta("SomeName");
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Example: user-defined init
///
/// Uninitialized `OnEditor<Gd<T>>` and `OnEditor<DynGd<T, D>>` can be created with `OnEditor::default()`.
///
/// ```
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// #[derive(GodotClass)]
/// #[class(base = Node)]
/// struct NodeHolder {
///     #[export]
///     required_node: OnEditor<Gd<Node>>,
///
///     base: Base<Node>
/// }
///
/// #[godot_api]
/// impl INode for NodeHolder {
///     fn init(base: Base<Node>) -> Self {
///        Self {
///            base,
///            required_node: OnEditor::default(),
///        }
///     }
/// }
///```
///
/// ## Example: factory pattern
///
/// ```
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// #[derive(GodotClass)]
/// #[class(init, base = Node)]
/// struct NodeHolder {
///     #[export]
///     required_node: OnEditor<Gd<Node>>,
/// }
///
/// fn create_and_add(
///     mut this: Gd<Node>,
///     some_class_scene: Gd<PackedScene>,
///     some_node: Gd<Node>,
/// ) -> Gd<NodeHolder> {
///     let mut my_node = some_class_scene.instantiate_as::<NodeHolder>();
///
///     // Would cause a panic:
///     // this.add_child(&my_node);
///
///     // It's possible to initialize the value programmatically, although typically
///     // it is set in the editor and stored in a .tscn file.
///     // Note: nodes are manually managed and leak memory unless tree-attached or freed.
///     my_node.bind_mut().required_node.init(some_node);
///
///     // Will not panic, since the node is initialized now.
///     this.add_child(&my_node);
///
///     my_node
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Using `OnEditor` with built-in types
///
/// `OnEditor<T>` can be used with any `#[export]`-enabled builtins, to provide domain-specific validation logic.
/// An example might be to check whether a game entity has been granted a non-zero ID.
///
/// To detect whether a value has been set in the editor, `OnEditor<T>` uses a _sentinel value_. This is a special marker value for
/// "uninitialized" and is selected by the user. For example, a sentinel value of `-1` or `0` might be used to represent an uninitialized `i32`.
///
/// There is deliberately no `Default` implementation for `OnEditor` with builtins, as the sentinel is highly domain-specific.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// use godot::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(GodotClass)]
/// #[class(init, base = Node)]
/// struct IntHolder {
///     // Uninitialized value will be represented by `42` in the editor.
///     // Will cause panic if not set via the editor or code before use.
///     #[export]
///     #[init(sentinel = 42)]
///     some_primitive: OnEditor<i64>,
/// }
///
/// fn create_and_add(mut this: Gd<Node>, val: i64) -> Gd<IntHolder> {
///     let mut my_node = IntHolder::new_alloc();
///
///     // Would cause a panic:
///     // this.add_child(&my_node);
///
///     // It's possible to initialize the value programmatically, although typically
///     // it is set in the editor and stored in a .tscn file.
///     my_node.bind_mut().some_primitive.init(val);
///
///     // Will not panic, since the node is initialized now.
///     this.add_child(&my_node);
///
///     my_node
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Using `OnEditor` with `#[class(tool)]`
///
/// When used with `#[class(tool)]`, the before-ready checks are omitted.
/// Otherwise, `OnEditor<T>` behaves the same — accessing an uninitialized value will cause a panic.
