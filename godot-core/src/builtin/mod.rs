//! Built-in types like `Vector2`, `GodotString` and `Variant`.
//!
//! # Background on the design of vector algebra types
//!
//! The basic vector algebra types like `Vector2`, `Matrix4` and `Quaternion` are re-implemented
//! here, with an API similar to that in the Godot engine itself. There are other approaches, but
//! they all have their disadvantages:
//!
//! - We could invoke API methods from the engine. The implementations could be generated, but it
//!   is slower and prevents inlining.
//!
//! - We could re-export types from an existing vector algebra crate, like `glam`. This removes the
//!   duplication, but it would create a strong dependency on a volatile API outside our control.
//!   The `gdnative` crate started out this way, using types from `euclid`, but [found it
//!   impractical](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdnative/issues/594#issue-705061720). Moreover,
//!   the API would not match Godot's own, which would make porting from GDScript (slightly)
//!   harder.
//!
//! - We could opaquely wrap types from an existing vector algebra crate. This protects users of
//!   `gdextension` from changes in the wrapped crate. However, direct field access using `.x`,
//!   `.y`, `.z` is no longer possible. Instead of `v.y += a;` you would have to write
//!   `v.set_y(v.get_y() + a);`. (A `union` could be used to add these fields in the public API,
//!   but would make every field access unsafe, which is also not great.)
//!
//! - We could re-export types from the [`mint`](https://crates.io/crates/mint) crate, which was
//!   explicitly designed to solve this problem. However, it falls short because [operator
//!   overloading would become impossible](https://github.com/kvark/mint/issues/75).
