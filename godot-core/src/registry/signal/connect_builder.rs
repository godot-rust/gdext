/// Builder for customizing signal connections.
///
/// Allows a high degree of customization for connecting [`TypedSignal`], while maintaining complete type safety.
///
/// See the [Signals](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/register/signals.html) chapter in the book for a general introduction and examples.
///
/// # Customization
/// Customizing your signal connection must be done **before** providing the function being connected
/// (can be done by using of the `connect_*` methods) (see section `Finalizing` bellow).
///
/// All these methods are optional, and they can be combined.
// Use HTML link due to conditional compilation; renders badly if target symbol is unavailable.
/// - [`name()`][Self::name]: Name of the `Callable` (for debug purposes).  \
///   If not specified, the Rust function name is used. This is typically a good default, but not very readable for closures.
/// - [`flags()`][Self::flags]: Provide one or multiple [`ConnectFlags`][crate::classes::object::ConnectFlags], possibly combined with bitwise OR.
///
/// # Finalizing
/// After customizing your builder, you can register the connection with various `connect_*` functions.
///
/// To connect to **methods** (member functions) with a signal object, you have the following combinations:
///
/// | Signal object | 1st parameter `&mut C`                         | 1st parameter `&mut Gd<C>`                   |
/// |---------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
/// | `self`        | [`connect_self_mut`][Self::connect_self_mut]   | [`connect_self_gd`][Self::connect_self_gd]   |
/// | other object  | [`connect_other_mut`][Self::connect_other_mut] | [`connect_other_gd`][Self::connect_other_gd] |
///
/// Methods taking `&C` can (e.g. using interior mutability) can be indirectly connected through a `*_gd` overload + a `Gd::bind()` call.
/// If this turns out to be a common use case, we could consider `connect_*_ref()` in the future.
///
/// <br>
///
/// For **global functions, associated functions and closures**, you can use the following APIs:
/// - [`connect()`][Self::connect]: Connect any function running on the same thread as the signal emitter.
/// - [`connect_sync()`](#method.connect_sync): Connect a global/associated function or closure that should be callable across threads.
///   Allows signals to be emitted from other threads.
///   - Requires `Send` + `Sync` bounds on the provided function.
///   - Is only available for the Cargo feature `experimental-threads`.
///
/// # Implementation and documentation notes
/// See [`TypedSignal` docs](struct.TypedSignal.html#implementation-and-documentation-notes) for a background on the `connect_*` API design.
///
/// <div class="warning">
/// <strong>Warning:</strong>
/// Exact type parameters are subject to change and not part of the public API. Since it's a type-state API, new states might require new
/// type parameters. Thus, try not to name the <code>ConnectBuilder</code> type in your code; most connection setup doesn't need it.
/// </div>
// If naming the type becomes a requirement, there may be some options:
// - Use a type alias in the module or TypedSignal, exposing only public parameters. This would work for constructor, but not all transformations.
// - Pack multiple types together into "type lists", i.e. custom structs carrying the type state. For a user, this would appear as one type,
// - which could also be #[doc(hidden)]. However, this may make the trait resolution more complex and worsen error messages, so not done now.
