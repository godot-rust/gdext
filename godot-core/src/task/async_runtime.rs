// Public interface

/// Create a new async background task.
///
/// This function allows creating a new async task in which Godot signals can be awaited, like it is possible in GDScript. The
/// [`TaskHandle`] that is returned provides synchronous introspection into the current state of the task.
///
/// Signals can be converted to futures in the following ways:
///
/// | Signal type | Simple future                | Fallible future (handles freed object) |
/// |-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
/// | Untyped     | [`Signal::to_future()`]      | [`Signal::to_fallible_future()`]       |
/// | Typed       | [`TypedSignal::to_future()`] | [`TypedSignal::to_fallible_future()`]  |
///
/// [`Signal::to_future()`]: crate::builtin::Signal::to_future
/// [`Signal::to_fallible_future()`]: crate::builtin::Signal::to_fallible_future
/// [`TypedSignal::to_future()`]: crate::registry::signal::TypedSignal::to_future
/// [`TypedSignal::to_fallible_future()`]: crate::registry::signal::TypedSignal::to_fallible_future
///
/// # Panics
/// If called from any other thread than the main thread.
///
/// # Examples
/// With typed signals:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use godot::prelude::*;
/// #[derive(GodotClass)]
/// #[class(init)]
/// struct Building {
///    base: Base<RefCounted>,
/// }
///
/// #[godot_api]
/// impl Building {
///    #[signal]
///    fn constructed(seconds: u32);
/// }
///
/// let house = Building::new_gd();
/// godot::task::spawn(async move {
///     println!("Wait for construction...");
///
///     // Emitted arguments can be fetched in tuple form.
///     // If the signal has no parameters, you can skip `let` and just await the future.
///     let (seconds,) = house.signals().constructed().to_future().await;
///
///     println!("Construction complete after {seconds}s.");
/// });
/// ```
///
/// With untyped signals:
/// ```no_run
/// # use godot::builtin::Signal;
/// # use godot::classes::Node;
/// # use godot::obj::NewAlloc;
/// let node = Node::new_alloc();
/// let signal = Signal::from_object_signal(&node, "signal");
///
/// godot::task::spawn(async move {
///     println!("Starting task...");
///
///     // Explicit generic arguments needed, here `()`:
///     signal.to_future::<()>().await;
///
///     println!("Node has changed: {}", node.get_name());
/// });
