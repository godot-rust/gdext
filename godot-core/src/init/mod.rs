///
/// # Example
/// The simplest usage is as follows. This will automatically perform the necessary init and cleanup routines, and register
/// all classes marked with `#[derive(GodotClass)]`, without needing to mention them in a central list. The order in which
/// classes are registered is not specified.

/// ```
///
/// # Custom entry symbol
/// There is usually no reason to, but you can use a different entry point (C function in the dynamic library). This must match the key
/// that you specify in the `.gdextension` file. Let's say your `.gdextension` file has such a section:
/// ```toml
/// [configuration]
/// entry_symbol = "custom_name"
/// ```
/// then you can implement the trait like this:
/// ```no_run
/// # use godot::init::*;
/// struct MyExtension;
///
/// #[gdextension(entry_symbol = custom_name)]
/// unsafe impl ExtensionLibrary for MyExtension {}
/// ```
/// Note that this only changes the name. You cannot provide your own function -- use the [`on_level_init()`][ExtensionLibrary::on_level_init]
/// hook for custom startup logic.
///
/// # Availability of Godot APIs during init and deinit
// Init order: see also special_cases.rs > classify_codegen_level().
/// Godot loads functionality gradually during its startup routines, and unloads it during shutdown. As a result, Godot classes are only
/// available above a certain level. Trying to access a class API when it's not available will panic (if not, please report it as a bug).
///
/// A few singletons (`Engine`, `Os`, `Time`, `ProjectSettings`) are available from the `Core` level onward and can be used inside
/// this method. Most other singletons are **not available during init** at all, and will only become accessible once the first frame has
/// run.
///
/// The exact time a class is available depends on the Godot initialization logic, which is quite complex and may change between versions.
/// To get an up-to-date view, inspect the Godot source code of [main.cpp], particularly `Main::setup()`, `Main::setup2()` and
/// `Main::cleanup()` methods. Make sure to look at the correct version of the file.
