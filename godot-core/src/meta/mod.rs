//! Meta-information about Godot types, their properties and conversions between them.
//!
//! # Conversions between types
//!
//! ## Godot representation
//!
//! The library provides two traits [`FromGodot`] and [`ToGodot`], which are used at the Rust <-> Godot boundary, both in user-defined functions
//! ([`#[func]`](../register/attr.godot_api.html#user-defined-functions)) and engine APIs ([`godot::classes` module](crate::classes)).
//! Their `to_godot()` and `from_godot()` methods convert types from/to their _closest possible Godot type_ (e.g. `GString` instead of Rust
//! `String`). You usually don't need to call these methods yourself, they are automatically invoked when passing objects to/from Godot.
//!
//! Most often, the two traits appear in pairs, however there are cases where only one of the two is implemented. For example, `&str` implements
//! `ToGodot` but not `FromGodot`. Additionally, [`GodotConvert`] acts as a supertrait of both [`FromGodot`] and [`ToGodot`]. Its sole purpose
//! is to define the "closest possible Godot type" [`GodotConvert::Via`].
//!
//! For fallible conversions, you can use [`FromGodot::try_from_godot()`].
//!
//! ## Variants
//!
//! [`ToGodot`] and [`FromGodot`] also implement a conversion to/from [`Variant`][crate::builtin::Variant], which is the most versatile Godot
//! type. This conversion is available via `to_variant()` and `from_variant()` methods. These methods are also available directly on `Variant`
//! itself, via `to()`, `try_to()` and `from()` functions.
//!
//! ## Class conversions
//!
//! Godot classes exist in a hierarchy. In OOP, it is usually possible to represent pointers to derived objects as pointer to their bases.
//! For conversions between base and derived class objects, you can use `Gd` methods [`cast()`][crate::obj::Gd::cast],
//! [`try_cast()`][crate::obj::Gd::try_cast] and [`upcast()`][crate::obj::Gd::upcast]. Upcasts are infallible.
//!
//! ## Argument conversions
//!
//! Rust does not support implicit conversions, however it has something very close: the `impl Into<T>` idiom, which can be used to convert
//! "T-compatible" arguments into `T`.
//!
//! This library specializes this idea with the trait [`AsArg<T>`]. `AsArg` allows argument conversions from arguments into `T`.
//! This is most interesting in the context of strings (so you can pass `&str` to a function expecting `GString`) and objects (pass
//! `&Gd<Node2D>` to a function expecting `Node2D` objects).
