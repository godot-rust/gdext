# Note: GDScript only uses ptrcalls if it has the full type information available at "compile" (parse) time.
# That includes all arguments (including receiver) as well as function signature (parameters + return type).
# Otherwise, GDScript will use varcall. Both are tested below.
# It is thus important that `ffi` is initialized using = for varcalls, and using := for ptrcalls.
