//! The **gdext** library implements Rust bindings for GDExtension, the C API of [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org).
//!
//! This documentation is a work in progress.
//!
//! # Type categories
//!
//! Godot is written in C++, which doesn't have the same strict guarantees about safety and
//! mutability that Rust does. As a result, not everything in this crate will look and feel
//! entirely "rusty". We distinguish four different kinds of types:
//!
//! 1. **Value types**: `i64`, `f64`, and mathematical types like
//!    [`Vector2`][crate::builtin::Vector2] and [`Color`][crate::builtin::Color].
//!
//!    These are the simplest to understand and to work with. They implement `Clone` and often
//!    `Copy` as well. They are implemented with the same memory layout as their counterparts in
//!    Godot itself, and typically have public fields. <br><br>
//!
//! 2. **Copy-on-write types**: [`GodotString`][crate::builtin::GodotString],
//!    [`StringName`][crate::builtin::StringName], and `Packed*Array` types.
//!
//!    These mostly act like value types, similar to Rust's own `Vec`. You can `Clone` them to get
//!    a full copy of the entire object, as you would expect.
//!
//!    Under the hood in Godot, these types are implemented with copy-on-write, so that data can be
//!    shared until one of the copies needs to be modified. However, this performance optimization
//!    is entirely hidden from the API and you don't normally need to worry about it. <br><br>
//!
//! 3. **Reference-counted types**: [`Array`][crate::builtin::Array],
//!    [`Dictionary`][crate::builtin::Dictionary], and [`Gd<T>`][crate::obj::Gd] where `T` inherits
//!    from [`RefCounted`][crate::engine::RefCounted].
//!
//!    These types may share their underlying data between multiple instances: changes to one
//!    instance are visible in another. Think of them as `Rc<RefCell<...>>` but without any runtime
//!    borrow checking.
//!
//!    Since there is no way to prevent or even detect this sharing from Rust, you need to be more
//!    careful when using such types. For example, when iterating over an `Array`, make sure that
//!    it isn't being modified at the same time through another reference.
//!
//!    To avoid confusion these types don't implement `Clone`. You can use
//!    [`Share`][crate::obj::Share] to create a new reference to the same instance, and
//!    type-specific methods such as
//!    [`Array::duplicate_deep()`][crate::builtin::Array::duplicate_deep] to make actual
//!    copies. <br><br>
//!
//! 4. **Manually managed types**: [`Gd<T>`][crate::obj::Gd] where `T` inherits from
//!    [`Object`][crate::engine::Object] but not from [`RefCounted`][crate::engine::RefCounted];
//!    most notably, this includes all `Node` classes.
//!
//!    These also share data, but do not use reference counting to manage their memory. Instead,
//!    you must either hand over ownership to Godot (e.g. by adding a node to the scene tree) or
//!    free them manually using [`Gd::free()`][crate::obj::Gd::free]. <br><br>
//!
//! # Ergonomics and panics
//!
//! gdext is designed with usage ergonomics in mind, making it viable for fast prototyping.
//! Part of this design means that users should not constantly be forced to write code such as
//! `obj.cast::<T>().unwrap()`. Instead, they can just write `obj.cast::<T>()`, which may panic at runtime.
//!
//! This approach has several advantages:
//! * The code is more concise and less cluttered.
//! * Methods like `cast()` provide very sophisticated panic messages when they fail (e.g. involved
//!   classes), immediately giving you the necessary context for debugging. This is certainly
//!   preferable over a generic `unwrap()`, and in most cases also over a `expect("literal")`.
//! * Usually, such methods panicking indicate bugs in the application. For example, you have a static
//!   scene tree, and you _know_ that a node of certain type and name exists. `get_node_as::<T>("name")`
//!   thus _must_ succeed, or your mental concept is wrong. In other words, there is not much you can
//!   do at runtime to recover from such errors anyway; the code needs to be fixed.
//!
//! Now, there are of course cases where you _do_ want to check certain assumptions dynamically.
//! Imagine a scene tree that is constructed at runtime, e.g. in a game editor.
//! This is why the library provides "overloads" for most of these methods that return `Option` or `Result`.
//! Such methods have more verbose names and highlight the attempt, e.g. `try_cast()`.
//!
//! To help you identify panicking methods, we use the symbol "⚠️" at the beginning of the documentation;
//! this should also appear immediately in the auto-completion of your IDE. Note that this warning sign is
//! not used as a general panic indicator, but particularly for methods which have a `Option`/`Result`-based
//! overload. If you want to know whether and how a method can panic, check if its documentation has a
//! _Panics_ section.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! [Godot's own thread safety
//! rules](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/performance/thread_safe_apis.html)
//! apply. Types in this crate implement (or don't implement) `Send` and `Sync` wherever
//! appropriate, but the Rust compiler cannot check what happens to an object through C++ or
//! GDScript.
//!
//! As a rule of thumb, if you must use threading, prefer to use [Rust threads](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread)
//! over Godot threads.
//!
//! The Cargo feature `threads` provides experimental support for multithreading. The underlying safety
//! rules are still being worked out, as such you may encounter unsoundness and an unstable API.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! The following features can be enabled for this crate. All off them are off by default.
//!
//! * **`formatted`**
//!
//!   Format the generated bindings with `rustfmt`. This significantly increases initial compile times and is
//!   mostly useful when you actively contribute to the library and/or want to inspect generated files.<br><br>
//!
//! * **`double-precision`**
//!
//!   Use `f64` instead of `f32` for the floating-point type [`real`][type@builtin::real]. Requires Godot to be compiled with the
//!   scons flag `precision=double`.<br><br>
//!
//! * **`custom-godot`**
//!
//!   Use a custom Godot build instead of the latest official release. This is useful when you like to use a
//!   version compiled yourself, with custom flags.
//!
//!   If you simply want to use a different official release, use this pattern instead (here e.g. for version `4.0`):
//!   ```toml
//!   # Trick Cargo into seeing a different URL; https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5478
//!   [patch."https://github.com/godot-rust/godot4-prebuilt"]
//!   godot4-prebuilt = { git = "https://github.com//godot-rust/godot4-prebuilt", branch = "4.0"}
//!   ```
//!   <br>
//!
//! * **`serde`**
//!
//!   Implement the [serde](https://docs.rs/serde) traits `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits for certain built-in types.
//!   The serialized representation underlies **no stability guarantees** and may change at any time, even without a SemVer-breaking change.
//!   <br><br>
//!
//! * **`threads`**
//!
//!   Experimental threading support. This enables `Send`/`Sync` traits for `Gd<T>` and makes the guard types `Gd`/`GdMut` aware of
//!   multi-threaded references. The safety aspects of this are not ironed out yet; use at your own risk. The API may also change
//!   at any time.
